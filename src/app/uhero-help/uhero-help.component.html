<h4 class="mt-4">Chart View</h4>

<p class="mt-3">
  Drop-down selectors indicate the currently displayed region and frequency. Use these drop-down selectors to change
  the display from “State of Hawaii”, “Annual” to “Honolulu County”, “Quarterly”. By moving the sliders at the top of
  the Chart View, you can adjust the range of displayed periods. You can also switch to Table View.
</p>
<p>
  Each chart in the main Chart View includes the name of the series, the date of the currently highlighted observation,
  the value (with units in parenthesis), and the year-over-year change (or percent change). You can hover your mouse
  cursor over each series to see the values at different points in time. Clicking on a series chart will open up the
  single-series view.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Table View</h4>
<img src="../../assets/uhero/tableView2x.png" alt="Screenshot of Table View" id="table-view">
<p class="mt-3">
  In Table View, you can toggle the display of the year-over-year change (or percent change). If more periods are
  selected than can be displayed at once, you can scroll the table horizontally to display the remaining observations.
  Click the “Download CSV” link to download the data in a format that loads in Excel.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Series View</h4>
<img src="../../assets/uhero/seriesView2x.png" alt="Screenshot of Series View" id="series-view">
<p class="mt-3">
  When viewing a single series, the line indicates the observations and the bars indicate the year-over-year change
  (or percent change). Beside the series title you can use the drop-down selectors to change the displayed region and
  frequency. You can also toggle whether the seasonally adjusted series or the raw series is displayed when both are
  available.
</p>
<p>
  On the top-left of the chart there are links to change the displayed periods to include the last year, the last five
  years, the last ten years, or all available data. You can also use the controls on the smaller chart below the main
  chart to manually adjust the displayed range. The smaller chart will always display the entire range.
</p>
<p>
  On the top-right of the chart area, click “Print” to print the current chart, or click “Download” to choose from
  PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF or CSV exports of the selected data.
</p>
<p>
  Below the chart is listed the source of the data, a link to the source agency, and any relevant notes. Below the
  series metadata we display summary statistics of the currently selected range. You can toggle the date order of the
  observations in the table below.
